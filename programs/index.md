## [Summer Camp 2021 - Click Here to Register!](/register)

## Goal
Robotics is an amalgamation of electronics & software programming to build robots. With the advent of 3D printing, we can design & print unique parts for our robots. Children will learn & understand micro:bit, write programs for it, and control electronics hardware. In this process they'll also learn basics of 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) modeling, to make interesting parts for their robot.

# What to Expect

## Hardware
Every child will get a micro:bit. Your child will bring the micro:bit to every class. The micro:bit is a handheld, programmable micro-computer that can be used for all sorts of cool creations, from robots to musical instruments. You can read more about the [**micro:bit**](https://microbit.org/guide){:target="_blank"}. At the end of our program the micro:bit is yours to keep and explore.

## Bring With You
