Odyssey of the Mind program was introduced with Brain Eating Machines

## Our Mission

At Brain Eating Machines, we wanted to provide a creative, problem-solving educational experience where students work together to solve predefined long-term problems. 

Encourage teamwork across age groups, critical thinking, innovation, and presentation skills through an internationally recognized program supported by sponsors such as NASA, IBM, and Arm & Hammer. Through problem solving mindset using resources locally and available at home, we're building the next generation of youth who will be engineers, programmers, and critical thinkers.

## Programs revolving Problems of following types

- **Technical Challenges** (e.g., building devices that perform tasks).

- **Classics/Theatrical challenges** involving art, mythology, or historical recreations.

- **Vehicle-based design**-  and operation tasks.

- **Performance-based**- creative writing and acting problems.

- **Primary Problems** specifically designed for K–2 graders, introducing younger children to creativity and performance in a simpler format.

## What Makes Us Different

OotM programs focus on more than Problem Solving. Students learn:

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackling real-world challenges through design thinking
- **Collaboration**: Working in teams to achieve common goals
- **Creativity**: Designing unique solutions to complex problems
- **Technical Skills**: Programming, engineering, and mechanical design
- **Presentation & Communication**: Sharing ideas and explaining technical concepts


## Program Intended vs Actuals
OOTM classes were intended to run from September through February. and 5/6 teams register for the program. With Covid 19, as the world came to a stand still, and in phase to figure everything out, 1 team met openly in the basement, front yard and finally did a real time presentation. 


## Real Results

Our students don't just learn—they excel. From winning competitions to developing innovative solutions for community problems, Brain Eating Machines alumni go on to pursue STEM careers and make meaningful contributions to their communities.
