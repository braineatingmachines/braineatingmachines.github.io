The Odyssey of the Mind program was introduced by Brain Eating Machines.

## Our Mission

At Brain Eating Machines, we want to provide a creative, problem-solving educational experience where students work together to solve predefined long-term problems.

We encourage teamwork across age groups, critical thinking, innovation, and presentation skills through an internationally recognized program supported by sponsors such as NASA, IBM, and Arm & Hammer. Through a problem-solving mindset using locally available resources and materials at home, we're building the next generation of engineers, programmers, and critical thinkers.

## Programs Involving the Following Problem Types

- **Technical Challenges** (e.g., building devices that perform tasks)

- **Classics/Theatrical Challenges** involving art, mythology, or historical recreations

- **Vehicle-Based Design** and operation tasks

- **Performance-Based** creative writing and acting problems

- **Primary Problems** specifically designed for K-2 graders, introducing younger children to creativity and performance in a simpler format

## What Makes Us Different

OOTM programs focus on more than problem-solving. Students learn:

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackling real-world challenges through design thinking
- **Collaboration**: Working in teams to achieve common goals
- **Creativity**: Designing unique solutions to complex problems
- **Technical Skills**: Programming, engineering, and mechanical design
- **Presentation & Communication**: Sharing ideas and explaining technical concepts


## Program Intended vs Actuals
OOTM classes were intended to run from September through February, and 5-6 teams registered for the program. With COVID-19, as the world came to a standstill and entered the phase of figuring everything out, 1 team continued to meet openly in the basement and front yard, and finally delivered a real-time presentation. 


## Real Results

Our students don't just learn—they excel. From winning competitions to developing innovative solutions for community problems, Brain Eating Machines alumni go on to pursue STEM careers and make meaningful contributions to their communities.
