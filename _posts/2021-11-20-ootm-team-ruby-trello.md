As coaches, we've used trello as a project management tool to keep track of dates and documents that need to be submitted. The screen shot above is for Team Vehicle Champions. It's a simple trello board, I maintained as kids streamed their ideas across the room. 


### Team Ruby
With things going virtual, and people not meeting in person, it is a lot more difficult for kids to manage their ideas. When in person, post-it notes has been our go-to solution for idea sharing and character identification, items to build, and other things.

This year we've decided to extend trello over to kids. These are screenshots of cards and lists, that kids (4th & 5th graders) have created, maintained and managed themselves.

Not only has the team used it for basic planning and coordination, but also taking it to the next level with additional labels, assignments and due dates to get things done!
