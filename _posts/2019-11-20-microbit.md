The micro:bit is designed by the BBC for use in computer education in the UK. It was designed to encourage children to get actively involved in writing software for computers and building new things, rather than being consumers of media.

The biggest advantage of using a micro:bit is the portability of powering it using 2xAA battery and carrying it around to show your project.

## Tech stuff
The device is described as half the size of a credit card and has an ARM Cortex-M0 processor, accelerometer and magnetometer sensors, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a display consisting of 25 LEDs, two programmable buttons, and can be powered by either USB or an external battery pack. The device inputs and outputs are through five ring connectors that form part of a larger 25-pin edge connector.
