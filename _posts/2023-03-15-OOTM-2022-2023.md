We're excited to welcome you to Brain Eating Machines, where young innovators discover the exciting world of robotics and engineering!

## Our Mission

At Brain Eating Machines, we believe that every student has the potential to be a creator, innovator, and problem-solver. Through hands-on robotics education using LEGO® Spike Prime, we're building the next generation of engineers, programmers, and critical thinkers.

## What Makes Us Different

Our programs focus on more than just building robots. Students learn:

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackling real-world challenges through design thinking
- **Collaboration**: Working in teams to achieve common goals
- **Creativity**: Designing unique solutions to complex problems
- **Technical Skills**: Programming, engineering, and mechanical design
- **Presentation & Communication**: Sharing ideas and explaining technical concepts

## Programs for Every Level

Whether your child is just starting their robotics journey or looking to advance to competitive robotics, we have programs designed for every skill level:

### After-School Programs
Weekly sessions where students explore robotics fundamentals, from basic building techniques to advanced programming concepts. Perfect for beginners and experienced students alike.

### Summer Camps
Intensive week-long camps featuring hands-on projects, 3D modeling with Tinkercad and Onshape, and progression from block-based coding to Python programming.

### Competitive Robotics
Prepare for regional and state competitions with dedicated coaching, innovation projects, and tournament preparation. Our teams learn robot design, strategy development, and gracious professionalism.

### Advanced Robotics Bridge
For students ready to transition from block-based programming to text-based coding with Arduino, Raspberry Pi Pico, and professional engineering tools.

## Real Results
