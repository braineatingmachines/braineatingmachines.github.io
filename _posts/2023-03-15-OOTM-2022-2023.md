## Odyssey Members(OMERs) & Coaches' Journey

Every year Coleman Odyssey of the Mind has been a fun ride for teams & coaches. It is typically that OMERs meet, read the problem statements in groups, decipher the details with coaches. They deep dive on some topics, do some research and bring back their findings. At some point, OMERs decide what/how/when/who of building together. There are days when OMERs dont agree. And sometimes the days do turn into weeks of dis-agreements & loud wallows.(Yep, irrespective of Core Values!)

Coaches do jump in, negoitate, ask questions and more questions, while OMERs re-read rules. What the coaches cannot strictly do is to offer a solution. 

Some ideas fall in place. Some ideas move forward, while many do not. OMERs continue to work on the art craft and mechanics. They learn to move forward together.

The team splits the roles. Some prefer building props, scenes, costumes and music. Some prefer to be on the stage and act, some will handle scene navigations, some will direct, write the play (phew!), the dialogues and some simply draw characters.

And when the Compeition dates come close, forseeably everything comes together. 

Truely, as a Coach I have seen - What might have started as a disagreement has the power to understand each other, exercise innovation, amd meet some level of progress - amidst it all!

Teams created a humorous performance about a dramatic character that overreacted to common events. The performance showcased different theatrical styles as the character overreacts. However, in one situation their reaction is justified, but they are ignored. 

The performance includes a mystery something that grows and a costume that represents two characters not one. Dont believe us, then check it here for yourself!

### Team 2 - Dinos on Parade (Primary)

Problem Summary - What better way to celebrate a new discovery than with a parade? Teams will create a performance all about dinosaurs. There will be a paleontologist character that discovers a “new” dinosaur that is invented by the team, an artistic representation of an already discovered dinosaur, and another portrayed by a team member in costume. These will all be presented in a fun parade!
