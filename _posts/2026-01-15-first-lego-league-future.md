LEGO® has introduced a new [**Computer Science & AI Kit**](https://education.lego.com/en-us/lego-education-computer-science-and-ai/) which is going to replace the current [Spike Prime Kit](https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-spike-prime-set/45678/). The Spike Prime kit is [retiring](https://education.lego.com/en-us/spike-update-2026/), and will be sunset by June 30, 2031.

## How does that affect FIRST® LEGO® League? 

On  January 12, 2026, [**FIRST® LEGO® League**](https://community.firstinspires.org/new-era-first-lego-league-future-edition) announced it is transitioning to this new kit starting season of 2026-2027. 

> FIRST® LEGO® League will enter a new, temporary chapter beginning August 2026, with two editions running in parallel through May 2028: 
>
>**Founders Edition (SPIKE™-based)**: The FIRST LEGO League program as it exists today, continuing with LEGO Education SPIKE™ technology. The last season for Founders Edition is 2027-2028. 
>
>**Future Edition (Based on LEGO Education Computer Science & AI hardware)**: A new experience powered by LEGO Education Computer Science & AI, designed to expand access and engagement for students and educators. The first season for Future Edition is the 2026-2027 season.

Information for this is still trickling down from FIRST and LEGO.

## Our Response
This is a **BIG**, but welcoming change. It presents an opportunity to adopt modern computing and AI concepts with greater emphasis on transferable programming and engineering skills. It is going to be an interesting evolution for FLL and teams on how they use the new hardware. 

Some of the sensors from the Spike prime kit are not as widely used in the competitions. Also the barriers for entry for some kids was way steeper than usual, and past couple of year's challenges, had turned into a line-following robot challenge. Considering all of these, I think this is a good change. 

The format and approach on how FIRST wants FLL to solve the challenges is closely aligned with how FTC and FRC championship games are run.


### AI Camera

The new AI kit seems to have a camera, or some kind of an optical device included. Having AI/ML vision models tuned to solve a particular problem, similar to [teachable machine by Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) should be interesting for kids.

### Two types of teams.
For now, we are looking to participate in both. We have teams who will continue with the Founders Edition for 2026-2027 season, and are also looking to form new teams to participate with the Future Edition of FLL. 

The curriculum will grow with additional AI enabled sensors, so will the FLL challenges, but the principles on how a robot moves remains the same. We are keeping our eyes and ears glued for the announcements from FIRST & LEGO. As we gather more information and participate in their roadshows, we will keep the community updated.
