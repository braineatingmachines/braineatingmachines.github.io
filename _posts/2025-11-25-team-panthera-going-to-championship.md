PantheraTech is a [FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/fll/) team and part of the **Competitive Robotics Training** program. This year's problem statement is [FIRST® AGE™ - UNEARTHED™](https://info.firstinspires.org/first-age#programs)

The team's complete code and project work is documented in [**GitHub**](https://github.com/varunmehta/73461-2025)

### Mission Plans
PantheraTech attended the [RoboCon](http://roboconnj.org) event at Bridgewater Commons, NJ and learned some tips from FLL veterans. The team came up with an extensive plan on how they would tackle the missions based off complexity. They created a mission-level risk-reward chart and used the chart to plan their approach. During the judging round, the judges were impressed by the level of the team's planning, which earned them a **4 = Exceeds** rating.

Of the missions available, the team was able to solve for up to 300 points, but due to time constraints, they were not able to complete all missions in the stipulated time period.
