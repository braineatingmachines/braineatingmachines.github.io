The team is part of the **Competitive Robotics Training** program, and participated in [FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/fll/). This year's problem statement was [FIRST® AGE™ - UNEARTHED™](https://info.firstinspires.org/first-age#programs)

The team's complete code and project work is documented in [GitHub](https://github.com/varunmehta/73461-2025)

### Mission Plans 
PantheraTech attended the RoboCon event at Bridgewater Commons, NJ and learnt some tips from veterans with previous years experience. The team came up with an extensive plan on how they plan to tackle the missions. The created a missionlevel-risk-reward chart, and used the chart to plan their approach. During the judging round, the judges were impressed by the level of teams planning which earned them a **4 = Exceeds** point.

Of missions available, the team was able to solve for up to 300 points, but due to time constraint, they were not able to solve all missions in the stipulated time period.
