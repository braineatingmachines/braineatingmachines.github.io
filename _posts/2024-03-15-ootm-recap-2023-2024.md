Come 2023-24, friends in town started asking about Odyssey of the Mind, we realized our small but dedicated group of volunteers needed to expand. We wanted to include students from Central, Hamilton, and Glen Rock Middle School, but coaching alone in the evenings wasn't sustainable. A simple call for help brought responses from entrepreneurial moms and likewise tech enthusiast parents. 

Glen Rock Community School provided classroom space, as we approached and we were able to include 29 kids from Hamilton, Coleman, Central, and Glen Rock Middle School across the town of Glen Rock. 

We were supported by a wonderful Glen Rock elementary teacher and four new parent coaches joining our original four Parent volunteers.

### Primary Team - The Night Life

When most people are sleeping, there is a whole new world that comes to life in the night. In this problem teams will create and present a performance about an explorer character that searches for things in nature that “wake up” at nighttime. It will also include a team-created original discovery, something that lights up, and a team member in costume that represents a nocturnal animal.
