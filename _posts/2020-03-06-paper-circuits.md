### Printable instructions coming soon!

Kids explored paper circuits. Using copper tape, LEDs and a CR2032 battery. The tasks was to tape up copper tape on a pre-drawn circuit, connect the LEDs in place of the eyes and when you fold the paper and the battery touches the terminals, the eyes (LED) would glow!
