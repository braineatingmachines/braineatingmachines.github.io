Every year Coleman Odyssey of the Mind has been a fun ride for teams & coaches. It is typical that OMERs met, read the problem statements in groups, deciphered the details with coaches. They deep dived on some topics, did some research and brought back their findings. At some point, OMERs decided what/how/when/who of building together. There were days when OMERs didn't agree. And sometimes the days did turn into weeks of disagreements & loud wallows. (Yep, irrespective of Core Values!)

Coaches jumped in, negotiated, asked questions and more questions, while OMERs re-read rules. What the coaches cannot strictly do is to offer a solution.

Some ideas fell in place. Some ideas moved forward, while many did not. OMERs continued to work on the art craft and mechanics. They learned to move forward together.

The team splits the roles. Some prefer building props, scenes, costumes and music. Some prefer to be on the stage and act, some will handle scene navigation, some will direct, write the play (phew!), the dialogues and some simply draw characters.

And when the Competition dates came close, everything came together.

Truly, as a Coach I have seen - What might have started as a disagreement has the power to understand each other, exercise innovation, and meet some level of progress - amidst it all!

Teams created a humorous performance about a dramatic character that overreacted to common events. The performance showcased different theatrical styles as the character overreacts. However, in one situation their reaction is justified, but they are ignored. 

The performance includes a mystery something that grows and a costume that represents two characters not one. Don't believe us, then check it here for yourself!

### Team 2 - Dinos on Parade (Primary)

Problem Summary - What better way to celebrate a new discovery than with a parade? Teams will create a performance all about dinosaurs. There will be a paleontologist character that discovers a “new” dinosaur that is invented by the team, an artistic representation of an already discovered dinosaur, and another portrayed by a team member in costume. These will all be presented in a fun parade!
