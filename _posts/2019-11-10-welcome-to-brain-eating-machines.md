title: Welcome to Brain Eating Machines
# subtitle: give me brains...

Brain Eating Machines is a pun at artificial intelligence taking over the world, rending humans irrelevant. In this day and age of computing, and with rapid development of new AI technologies, it is time we introduce children to not only just use technology, but also understand its inner workings and build the next generation of it.

I'm a dad of two girls aged 9 & 5, I personally love all things maths and science, and am always trying to find ways to introduce STEM to kids. Last year with the help and support of the school HSA, I introduced STEM nights at Coleman Elementary School, Glen Rock.

I have degree in electrical engineering, and am software engineer by profession past 20 years.
