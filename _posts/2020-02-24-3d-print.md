Last time we decided to build a [3D model of a snowman](/2020-02-14-snowman-blockscad). This week we decided to generate a [gcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) using [Cura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura_(software)). The slices of the snowman were explored in Cura.

Once the slices were understood, and print settings were finalized, and the 3D printer got to printing...
