## What a year it has been! 

We started the program with a huge interest from multiple students and parents. Over 24 students registered for the program. Parents signed up as volunteers and we had a parent-coach support structure in place to support the ecosystem.

## OMERs to the Rescue Again!(Category - Vehicle)

Who better to help those in distress than OMER? 

1. In this problem, OMER and his trusty Sidekick travelled to different places with suitcases holding all of the parts of an OMER-mobile vehicle! 

2. OMER and his Sidekicks assemble and ride on the vehicle where it functions in different ways to “save the day.” 

3. Between attempts, the vehicle is disassembled, put back into the suitcases, and taken to a different area where it will be reassembled and driven again. 

4. Finally, the OMER-mobile is thrown a hero’s parade as a show of appreciation!
