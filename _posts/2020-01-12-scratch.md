Scratch is a block-based visual programming language targeted primarily at children. Kids can create projects using a block-like interface. The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, is used in most parts of the world.

With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.

Scratch is used in many different settings: schools, libraries, and homes. The interface from scratch is similar to other block programming languages.
