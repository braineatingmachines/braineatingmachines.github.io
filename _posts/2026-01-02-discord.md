We've created a [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/NwwZeJHwca) for parents/guardians of students in our program. This is your hub for all things related to our [robotics programs](/). Whether your child is just starting or advancing through the full curriculum, this is the place to stay connected, ask questions, and support each other.

## What Is This Server For?
* Program updates and announcements
* Scheduling information and reminders
* Asking questions about curriculum or logistics
* Connecting with other robotics families
* Getting technical support and resources

### Announcements
We'll publish announcements for upcoming sessions, change in schedule due to snow days(if any), scrimmages, or any other important details.

### Carpooling
As working parents of kids who are signed up for a few after-school programs, coordinating with other parents to arrange pick-up and drop-off routines is a herculean task. We've introduced a [#carpooling](https://discord.com/channels/1453241910259875994/1453405502321987634) channel for parents to support each other for pick-up/drop-off coordination.
