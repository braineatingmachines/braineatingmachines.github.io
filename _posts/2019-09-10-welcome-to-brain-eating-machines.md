Brain Eating Machines is a *quip* at [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) taking over the world, rending humans irrelevant.

In this day and age of computing, and with rapid development of new & emerging AI technologies, it is time we introduce children to not just consume technology, but also learn its inner working and help build the next generation of it.

Being a dad of two smart girls aged 9 & 5, I'm always trying to find ways to excite them with all things maths and science. Last year with the help and support of the Coleman school HSA, we were able to conduct our first STEM night.

Brain Eating Machines is an attempt to introduce kids with things around robotics.
