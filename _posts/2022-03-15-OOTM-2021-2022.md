## Our Mission
Odyssey of the Mind(OOTM) program is a creative, problem-solving educational experience where students work together to solve predefined long-term problems. OOTM encourages teamwork across age groups, critical thinking, innovation, and presentation skills through an internationally recognized program supported by sponsors such as NASA, IBM, and Arm & Hammer.

Through problem solving mindset using resources locally and available at home, we believe will build next generation of youth who will be engineers, programmers, and critical thinkers of the world.

## What Problem Types were picked

Our programs focus on more than just building robots. Students learn:

- **Technical Challenges** (e.g., building devices that perform tasks).

- **Performance-based**- creative writing and acting problems.


### After-School/Weekend Programs
