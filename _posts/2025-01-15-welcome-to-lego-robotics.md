When a student's robot successfully completes its first mission, something clicks. Engineering isn't intimidating, it's thrilling. That moment of realization drives everything we do at Brain Eating Machines. Building on our 5+ year track record with [**Odyssey of the Mind**](/news/2019/09/02/welcome-to-ootm/), we're now bringing that same hands-on, confidence-building approach to LEGO® Spike Prime robotics education in Glen Rock.

## How does robotics help?

Our programs focus on more than just building robots. Students learn:

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackling real-world challenges through design thinking
- **Collaboration**: Working in teams to achieve common goals
- **Creativity**: Designing unique solutions to complex problems
- **Technical Skills**: Programming, engineering, and mechanical design
- **Presentation & Communication**: Sharing ideas and explaining technical concepts
