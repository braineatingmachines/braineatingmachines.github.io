# Image Optimization Notes
# Priority images for optimization (sorted by size):
# 1. workshops.jpg - 2.5MB
# 2. electronics.jpeg - 2.2MB
# 3. spike-prime-box.jpeg - 1.7MB
# 4. hero.jpg - 1.4MB
# 5. adb_1.jpeg - 1.4MB
# 6. gears.jpg - 1.3MB

# Recommended optimization targets:
# - Compress JPEGs to 80% quality
# - Generate WebP variants for all large images
# - Create responsive variants: [400w, 800w, 1200w]
# - Use lazy loading for below-fold images
