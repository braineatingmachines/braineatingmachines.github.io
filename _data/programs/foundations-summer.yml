    description:
      - "The first week immerses students in robotics fundamentals. Starting from scratch, students build their LEGO SPIKE Prime robot and learn block-based programming to control motors and create precise movements. They'll master basic navigation, turning, and distance measurement."
      - "Students then dive into the full sensor suite—ultrasonic distance sensors for obstacle detection, color sensors for line following and recognition, and force sensors for touch and pressure feedback. By week's end, they'll program autonomous robots that use all three sensor types to navigate and respond intelligently to their environment."

    description:
      - "Week two expands into mechanical design. Students learn how gears transfer motion, build gear trains to change speed and torque, and construct robot arms and manipulators that can grab, lift, and move objects."
      - "Combining their mechanical builds with all three sensor types, students create sophisticated robots that sense their environment and physically interact with it. The week culminates in a final showcase project where students demonstrate advanced problem-solving, engineering design, and computational thinking skills."
