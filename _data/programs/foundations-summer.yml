    description:
      - "The first week immerses students in robotics fundamentals. Starting from scratch, students build their LEGO SPIKE Prime robot and learn block-based programming to control motors and create precise movements. They'll master basic navigation, turning, and distance measurement."
      - "By mid-week, students integrate ultrasonic distance sensors, enabling their robots to detect and respond to obstacles autonomously. Through exciting challenges, they'll program intelligent robots that navigate complex environments and make decisions based on sensor feedback."
