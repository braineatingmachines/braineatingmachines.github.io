    description: "The SPIKE Prime Robotics program is a set of three modules, each progressively building on the previous module. The program will introduce kids to robot movement and multiple sensors for distance, color, and force sensing."
    module_info: "In this exciting first module, students will build their very own LEGO SPIKE Prime robot from scratch and learn the fundamentals of programming. They'll explore block-based coding to make their robot move forward, backward, and turn with precision. Through hands-on challenges, your child will practice measuring distances, calculating angles, and navigating obstacle courses. By week's end, they'll confidently program their robot to complete multi-step navigation tasks independently."
    # additional_modules: "Module 2 will cover distance and color sensors, and Module 3 includes force sensors and multi-sensor integration, preparing students for advanced robotics opportunities, including competitive robotics and high school robotics clubs."
    registration_note: "Note: Modules 2 and 3 will be offered in future sessions."
    what_students_learn:
      - "Robot assembly and mechanical design"
      - "Block-based programming fundamentals"
      - "Precise movement and navigation"
      - "Distance and angle calculations"
      - "Multi-step programming tasks"
