  description: "The SPIKE Prime Robotics program is a set of three modules, each progressively building on the previous module. The program will introduce kids to robot movement and multiple sensors for distance, color, and force sensing."
  module_info: "In this exciting first module, students will build their very own LEGO SPIKE Prime robot from scratch and learn the fundamentals of programming. They'll explore block-based coding to make their robot move forward, backward, and turn with precision using the gyro. Through hands-on challenges, your child will practice measuring distances, calculating angles, and navigating obstacle courses. By week's end, they'll confidently program their robot to complete multi-step navigation tasks independently."
  registration_note: "Note: Modules 2 and 3 will be offered in future sessions."
