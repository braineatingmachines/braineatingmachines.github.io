  description: "The SPIKE Prime Robotics program is a set of three modules, each progressively building on the previous module. The program will introduce kids to robot movement and multiple sensors for distance, color, and force sensing."
  module_info: "In this exciting first module, students will build their very own LEGO SPIKE Prime robot from scratch and learn the fundamentals of programming. They'll explore block-based coding to make their robot move forward, backward, and turn with precision using the gyro. Through hands-on challenges, your child will practice measuring distances, calculating angles, and navigating obstacle courses. By week's end, they'll confidently program their robot to complete multi-step navigation tasks independently."
  registration_note: "Note: Modules 2 and 3 will be offered in future sessions."
  what_students_learn:
    - "Robot assembly and mechanical design"
    - "Block-based programming fundamentals"
    - "Precise movement and navigation"
    - "Distance and angle calculations"
    - "Multi-step programming tasks"
  instructor: "Varun Mehta"

  description: "The SPIKE Prime Robotics program is a set of three modules, each progressively building on the previous module. The program will introduce kids to robot movement and multiple sensors for distance, color, and force sensing."
  module_info: "In Module 2, students will expand their robotics skills by exploring distance and color sensors. They'll learn to program their SPIKE Prime robot to detect objects, measure distances, and identify colors, enabling autonomous decision-making. Through engaging challenges, students will combine sensor input with movement programming to navigate complex courses and respond to environmental cues."
