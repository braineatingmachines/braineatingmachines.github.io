# Claude.md Guidelines

 * Always follow brand colors, and reuse css where needed before creating new css files specific to a new page. 
 * Try to keep js files in one location and reuse code as much as possible when creating new scripts.
 * Always externalize javascript files when creating new features, and add compression to minimize them for quick browser downloads.
 * Create minimum HTML when creating new pages, and try to follow modular structures via Jekyll where needed. 
 * For simple text heavy pages, stick to markdown files.
 * Always try to offload as much tasks as possible to ollama gemini running locally to save tokens. 
 * Refine your prompting to gemini to get the best local results.
