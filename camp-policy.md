- Staff will observe students for signs of illness throughout the day.
- Any student exhibiting symptoms of illness will be isolated and parents will be contacted for pickup.

## Safety & Supervision

- **Supervision Ratios:** We maintain appropriate student-to-instructor ratios to ensure safety and quality learning experiences (typically 8:1 or better).
- **Facility Safety:** All camp locations meet safety standards and regulations. First aid supplies are available and restocked within 48 hours of use.
- **Emergency Procedures:** Staff are trained in emergency response procedures, including fire drills, lock-downs, and medical emergencies.
- **Drop-Off and Pick-Up:** Students must be signed in and out by an authorized adult. Only individuals listed on the registration form may pick up students unless we receive written authorization.
