            Robotics competitions (tournaments) are held regionally and at the state level. Teams present their innovation
            projects, demonstrate their robots in timed matches, and interview with judges about their robot design
            and core values. Teams are evaluated on robot performance, innovation projects, robot design, and teamwork.
