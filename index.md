## what we do
At **Brain Eating Machines**, we’re building the foundation for a future where intelligent robots coexist with people in everyday environments. Our focus is on developing the hardware, software, and AI systems that make general-purpose robots practical, adaptable, and human-friendly. Designed to be safe, lightweight, and low-cost, our robots serve as a platform for experimentation, innovation, and real-world problem solving.

The name "**Brain Eating Machines**" is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the effects of brain muscle atrophy caused by underuse. We're here to counter that by helping humans strengthen their cognitive muscles—through learning, building, and collaborating with intelligent machines.
