## what we do
At **Brain Eating Machines**, we’re building the foundation for a future where robots coexist with other robots and people in everyday environments. Our focus is on developing the hardware, software, and AI systems that make robots communication practical, adaptable, and human-friendly. Designed to be safe, lightweight, and low-cost, our platform is ideal for experimentation, innovation, and real-world problem solving.

The name "**Brain Eating Machines**" is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the effects of brain muscle atrophy caused by underuse, and over reliance on AI. We're here to counter that by helping humans strengthen their cognitive muscles—through learning, building, and collaborating with intelligent machines.
