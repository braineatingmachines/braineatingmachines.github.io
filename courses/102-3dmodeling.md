## Learning outcome
As part of this program, children will learn the basics of 3D modeling, orthographic design, and age appropriate [CAD tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design). At the end of the class, a basic item they have designed will be 3D printed.

## Homework
A weekly homework to build something based of what was learnt will be assigned. The kids have to complete the homework and bring it in before the next session. Parental guidance might be required for the homework, though not necessary. Consistently skipping the homework, will not reap the expected results from this course.
