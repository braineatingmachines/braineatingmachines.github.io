We have different age appropriate learning tracks available for kids of all ages. The 101 series is geared more towards elementary kids up to 5th grade, 201 for middle and 301 for high school kids.

### [Robotics 101](101-robotics)

Introduction to Robotics is designed for elementary kids, as an entry to robotics. This is an 8 weeks class, held once a week. The curriculum for the program is derived from code.org, khan academy and other resources. It is built around using the micro:bit as one of the primary micro-controllers for hardware control.

### [Robotics 201](201-robotics)

Intermediate Robotics is designed for middle school grade kids, as an expansion to Robotics 101. Children will grasp a deeper understanding of hardware, [CAD Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design){:target="_blank"}. [**[Read More]**](201-robotics)

### [Robotics 301](301-robotics)

Advanced robotics is not a unified class, it is split into specializations of hardware, 3d modeling and advanced programming as separate tracks. We are still working out the details of these individual classes and will update this section soon.
