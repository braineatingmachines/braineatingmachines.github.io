# What to Expect

**Robotics - 101** is designed for elementary school kids, as an entry to basic programming, 3D modeling and robotics. This is an 8 weeks class, held once a week. The curriculum for the program is derived from code.org, khanacademy and other resources. It is built around using the micro:bit as one of the primary micro-controllers for hardware control.

## Learning Outcome
Robotics is an amalgamation of electronics hardware & software programming to build robots. With the advent of 3D printing, we can build new unique parts for our robots. Children will learn & understand the basics of micro:bit, learn to write programs on it, and control basic external devices. They'll also learn basics of 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) modeling, and make some interesting parts.

### Hardware
As part of the program, every child will get a micro:bit device. Your child has to bring the micro:bit to every class. The micro:bit is a handheld, programmable micro-computer that can be used for all sorts of cool creations, from robots to musical instruments. You can read more about the [**micro:bit**](https://microbit.org/guide){:target="_blank"}. At the end of the program the micro:bit is yours to keep and explore.


## Items to bring to class
Every child is expected to bring their own laptop with wifi capabilities to access the internet. Internet access will be provided. We expect your child to be comfortable using the laptop keyboard and trackpad or mouse. The laptop should have a working accessible regular USB port. Tablets, iPads of any kinds are NOT a good replacement. Please have Google Chrome installed on the laptop for familiarity across all laptops. Windows, MacOS and Chromebook are welcome.

If you have parental controls enabled and have to approve websites before you let them access it, please let us know. We can provide a list of websites you need to approve as part of this program.

## Homework
A weekly homework to build something based of what was learnt will be assigned. The kids have to complete the homework and bring it in before the next session. Parental guidance might be required for the homework, though not necessary. Consistently skipping the homework, will not reap the expected results from this course. If your child is unable to do the homework, due to lack of understanding the problem, please bring it to the notice of the teacher before the next session.

## Basic Responsibility
Every child is expected to be responsible for their own devices in the class. They are expected to be respectable of other children's devices in the class. Parents will be notified for any child damaging property belonging to others, or consistently causing disruptions in class. Inaction to stop such behavior after two warnings, will result in discontinuation.

## Weather
If a class is being cancelled due to inclement weather, an alternate date will be provided.
