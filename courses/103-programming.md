# What to Expect

**Introduction to Programming - 103** is designed for elementary kids, as an entry to programming. This is an 8 weeks class, held once a week. The curriculum for the program is derived from code.org, khan academy and other resources. It is built around using [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) block programming as one of the primary software skills.

**This session is not open for registrations yet.**

## Learning outcome
As part of this program, children will learn the basics of block programming. At the end of the class, the kids will design a game in scratch.

## Items to bring to class
Every child is expected to bring their own laptop with wifi capabilities to access the internet. Internet access will be provided. We expect your child to be comfortable using the laptop keyboard and trackpad or mouse. The laptop should have a working accessible regular USB port.

## Homework
A weekly homework to build something based of what was learnt will be assigned. The kids have to complete the homework and bring it in before the next session. Parental guidance might be required for the homework, though not necessary. Consistently skipping the homework, will not reap the expected results from this course. If your child is unable to do the homework, due to lack of understanding the problem, please bring it to the notice of the teacher before the next session.
