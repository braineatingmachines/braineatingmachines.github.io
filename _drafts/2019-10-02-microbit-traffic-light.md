For this winter break, we decided to make a basic working model of a traffic light. The 3 LEDs cycle through green color (10 seconds), yellow color (3 seconds), red color (8 seconds).

# Items Needed

 * Copper Tape
 * 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) ~ This can also be extended to use a single RGB LED.
 * micro:bit
 * 10"x 10" cardboard piece to connect hardware.

# Learning Outcome

You learn to control 3 LEDs timed at different intervals to emulate a real life traffic signal.
