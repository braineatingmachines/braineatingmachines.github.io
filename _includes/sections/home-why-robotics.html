      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        As robots perform surgery, drive cars, and AI assistants manage our homes,
        understanding robotics is essential literacy; like learning geography without
        becoming a sailor or biology without becoming a doctor. Students who grasp
        how sensors, algorithms, and machines work become informed citizens who can
        shape technology's future rather than simply being shaped by it.
