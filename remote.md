subtitle: We are trying online classes!

With the advent of COVID-19, we have suspended all in-person classes. Brain Eating Machines is trying online classes as an option for training.

# Robotics 101

We are hosting [robotics 101](courses/101-robotics) for now on the remote sessions, depending upon the response and feel, we'll go ahead and expand the program to other grades. The session is limited to a maximum of 8 kids. If we have more than 8 kids, we'll try to have additional sessions.

Please [register here to enroll](courses/register).

## Tools for online sessions.

We'll be leveraging [zoom](https://zoom.us) meetings to conduct online classes. Please [download a suitable client](https://zoom.us/download) for your child's laptop. We'll be video streaming the lesson, along with screen share for any sessions held on the computer. You can have the zoom client also running on the iPad with work being done on the laptop.

Please install and [test](https://zoom.us/test) zoom before the first session to ensure we don't run into technical issues when the class starts.

### Hardware resources.
As part of the effort, I'll try the best to get the hardware kits to you as curbside drop offs.
