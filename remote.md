subtitle: We are going online!

With the advent of [COVID-19](https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/ncov.shtml), we have suspended all in-person classes. Brain Eating Machines is trying online classes as an alternative during these trying times.

# Robotics 101

As of now, we are hosting only [**robotics 101**](/courses/101-robotics) for remote sessions. Depending upon the response, we'll expand the program to higher grades students. The session is limited to a maximum of 8 kids. If we have more than 8 kids, we'll try to accommodate with additional sessions.

We need at least 4 kids for a successful online session.

**Please [register here to enroll](/courses/register).**

## Days and Times

We are looking to conduct sessions on 1 of 3 days listed below. Please select at least 2 (in the [registration form](/courses/register)) options from the list. The day with most kids available, will be the one selected.

 * Wednesday, 6:00 - 7:00 pm
 * Saturday, 1:00 - 2:00 pm
 * Sunday, 1:00-2:00 pm

## Tools for online sessions.

Computer with working USB port, webcam and mic.

We are using [zoom](https://zoom.us) meetings to conduct online classes.

Please [download a client](https://zoom.us/download) for your child's computer (Windows/Mac/Chromebook/Linux). We'll conduct live interactive  video lessons, along with screen share for any sessions held on the computer.

Optional: You can also have the zoom client running on an iPad with work being done on the laptop.

Please install and [test](https://zoom.us/test) zoom before the first session to ensure we don't run into technical issues when the class starts.

### Hardware resources.
As part of the online class, once you register, we'll do a curbside/mailbox drop off of the hardware kit (micro:bit) at your place.

## Fees for online sessions.
$240 for 8 sessions.

If a sibling joins, the fees is $160 for them (limit 1). Each sibling will have to get their own computer for the lab.

> This is COVID-19 pricing. Once normalcy resumes, we will revert fees back to regular pricing from the next sessions.

## FAQ

### Do I have to buy a kit for this class ?
The micro:bit is included in the price of the sessions. We'll be doing a curbside drop-off of the micro:bit and additional hardware, before the sessions start. You'll need to provide some basic hardware at home, like old cardboard box, scotch tape, aluminum foil, old pair of wired headphones. If there is something needed for the class and you don't have it as an every day item at home, we'll try to provide substitutes where possible.
